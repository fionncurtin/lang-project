## About this Project:
This project compares the lexical similarities between different branches of
the Indo-Euroepean language family, the largest such family in the world.

This does not mean categorizing branches are in a genetic sense, as linguists typically do, but instead just looking at how similar the Swdesh (universal)
words are between the different branches.
